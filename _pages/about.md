Xingyuan did both his bachelor’s and master’s in mechatronics engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology. During these years, he worked on computer vision (hand pose estimation, generative models, etc.) and then shifted to model-based reinforcement learning after inspired by the World Model paper. During his master’s thesis, he studied different ways to construct the world model and evaluate them based on the information gains. After that, he worked for one year as a Machine Learning Engineer at Polixir Technology, an AI startup in Nanjing focuses on real-world RL applications. During this peroid, he discovered that no RL algorithms really works on real-world problems where data is conservative and limited. It made him believe injecting knowledge into the model is the only remedy. He joined MLRL in February 2022 as a doctoral candidate to continuous his research journey.

Xingyuan is interested in incorporating general knowledge into the world model in a scalable way to improve its sample efficiency and the ability to generalize to OOD data. Besides, he is generally happy to discuss any fun ideas in the AI field.
